In the heart of every child is a hunger for home. Not just for food and a place to sleep, but for safety and community. Most importantly: for love. We are much more than a home for unwanted Indian orphans. We are a family, where Godâ€™s love guides us all as we grow and expand year after year. Not just an Indian orphanage, we are a nearly self-sustaining organization; a working farm, a vibrant school, receiving no government assistance of any kind.              </p>
